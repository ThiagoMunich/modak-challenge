## Get started

1. Clone the Repository

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/thiagomunich/modak-challenge.git
   cd modak-challenge
   ```

2. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   npx expo install
   ```

3. Prebuild

   ```bash
   npx expo prebuild
   ```
   
4. Execute prebuild on simulator device
   ```bash
   npx expo run:android 
   #or 
   npx expo run:ios
   ```
   This will build the app and open it on the simulator or your connected device. It will also install the app icon so you can open it later.

5. Run on Expo Go (for quick tests without the 4th step)
   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```
   Scan the QR code using the Expo Go app on your phone to quickly preview the app without needing a full native build.
